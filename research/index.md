<strong>Competition Among Retail Depository Institutions: The Market Power of Credit Unions</strong><br />
Over the last few decades, credit unions have become more prominent as depository institutions and producers of small business loans and mortgages. This marks a significant change from the past, when their lending was dominated by small consumer loans. In response, commercial banks have expressed concern about competition from credit unions. They claim that credit unions directly compete with commercial banks and, unlike commercial banks, unfairly benefit from a tax-exempt status. While the presence of credit unions in certain areas has been growing, they remain small in size and market share relative to commercial banks. This paper uses an entry model with endogenous product choices to test whether credit unions affect the profits of national and local commercial banks.


<strong>Cross-Sectional Patterns of Mortgage Debt during the Housing Boom: Evidence and Implications</strong><br />
<i>With Christopher L. Foote and Paul S. Willen</i><br />
The reallocation of mortgage debt to low-income or marginally qualified borrowers plays a central role in many explanations of the early 2000s housing boom. We show that such a reallocation never occurred, as the distribution of mortgage debt with respect to income changed little during the boom. Additionally, although the homeownership rate began rising in the mid-1990s, it peaked before the mortgage boom ended, and there is no evidence that increases in homeownership during the boom were concentrated among low-income or marginal borrowers. Previous cross-sectional research stressing the importance of low-income borrowers and communities during the mortgage boom was based on the <i>inflow</i> of new mortgage originations alone. As a result, it could not detect offsetting <i>outflows</i> in mortgage terminations that left the allocation of debt with respect to income stable over time.
