<strong>Consumption of Housing During the 2000s Boom: Evidence and Theory</strong><br />
<i>Job Market Paper</i><br />
I analyze the consumption of owner occupied housing services during the boom and bust. Households that already owned homes (continuing homeowners) increased their consumption of housing services during the boom, while the probability of households transitioning from renting into homeownership did not increase significantly. To explain these results, I develop and solve a partial equilibrium life cycle model that incorporates tenure choice, multiple house sizes, and non-recourse default. The results are driven by expectations for higher future rents that increase the price of housing today and a debt-to-income constraint that limits the transition of renters into homeownership. Both in the data and the model, continuing homeowners do not substantially increase their non-housing consumption. The fall in the user cost of housing services causes households to substitute away from other consumption and towards housing, so that continuing homeowners spend their increase in wealth on housing. The option to default places a ceiling on the user cost when house prices fall, limiting the decrease in demand for housing services during the bust.

<strong>Competition Among Retail Depository Institutions: The Market Power of Credit Unions</strong><br />
<i>Draft available upon request.</i><br />
Over the last few decades, credit unions have become more prominent as depository institutions and producers of small business loans and mortgages. This marks a significant change from the past, when their lending was dominated by small consumer loans. In response, commercial banks have expressed concern about competition from credit unions. They claim that credit unions directly compete with commercial banks and, unlike commercial banks, unfairly benefit from a tax-exempt status. While the presence of credit unions in certain areas has been growing, they remain small in size and market share relative to commercial banks. This paper uses an entry model with endogenous product choices to test whether credit unions affect the profits of national and local commercial banks and finds that credit unions are not a threat to commercial banks. In contrast, large, multi-market commercial banks do have a significant negative effect on the profits of small, local commercial banks.
